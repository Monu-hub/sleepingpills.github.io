      <p>Gabapentin is available by the brand name Neurontin. It can be defined as an anti-convulsant medicine used for treating neuropathic discomfort and partial seizures in patients. It has emerged as the first resort medicine chiefly used for curing neuropathic discomfort triggered by diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. </p>
        <h2>What is Gabapentin?</h2>
<p>Gabapentin can be purchased in the form of an oral capsule, an instant release oral tablet, an oral solution, or a prolonged-release oral tablet. People can also buy Gabapentin for sleep as a generic drug. The cost of the generic drug is usually less when compared with the brand name version. In some situations, the generic drug and the brand name drug will remain available in changed strengths and forms.</p>

<p>People will find Gabapentin oral capsules in the form of generic as well as brand name drug Neurontin. Gabapentin has emerged effectively in curing partial seizures in children and adults. People can also rely on it for treating gabapentin nerve pain triggered by shingles infection. </p>
<h3>How does Gabapentin work?</h3>
<p>Gabapentin functions in the body by changing electrical movement in the brain and promoting the chemicals' activity known as neurotransmitters that may send messages between nerve cells. It also helps in soothing the activity of nerves and brings down the intensity of seizures or their occurrence. Children and adults are eligible to take the drugs. The Neurontin drug is capable of curing one type of epilepsy in children of 3 years old. </p>
<h3>Gabapentin Dosage and Usage Instructions</h3>
<p>It is important to remain aware of the correct Gabapentin dosage. The dosage of the medicine will rely on various other factors. These may include Gabapentin type and brand, the strength of the product, condition of the patient, kidney function of a patient, weight, age, and health condition.</p>

<p>The daily doses of the medicine, gaps between doses, and duration of time that an individual may take Gabapentin will not remain the same for every person. An individual may take some types of Gabapentin with food, but it may not be necessary for the other forms.</p>

<p>If someone is taking Gabapentin, the person may take it in the evening and night.</p>

<p>There are some brands or dosages available online that will necessitate them to break in half. Individuals must use the remaining half portion of the medicine with the next dose or use that at the earliest.</p>

<p>People should not break or chew the extended-release Gabapentin for pain. They should swallow the tablet as a whole. If an individual happens to miss a dose of Gabapentin, they should read carefully the instructions specified on labeling. </p>

<p>Patients should start with a low dose of Gabapentin and modify it over time to reach the dosage appropriate for people. Initially, the smallest dosage of Gabapentin will help in providing the desired outcome. Below are the details of Gabapentin dosage that people should take:</p>

<p>It is available in different forms and strengths. The generic Gabapentin is available in the form of an oral capsule. It can be purchased in the strengths of 100 mg, 300 mg, and 400 mg. Meanwhile, you can purchase the other brand known as Neurontin in the form of an oral capsule. People can buy it in the strengths of 100 mg, 300 mg, and 400 mg.</p>

<p>The correct dosage for postherpetic neuralgia will remain different for adults, children, and senior citizens. For adult dosage or age group between 18 to 64, the ideal starting dose will be 300 mg on day 1, 600 mg on day 2 (can take 300 mg twice a day), 900 mg on day 3 (300 mg thrice a day). You should evenly space the dosage throughout the day. The maximum dosage should be 1800 mg/day to be taken 600 mg thrice a day in an evenly spaced manner.</p>

<p>For children between the age of 0 o 17 years, there is no dosage established yet. </p>
<p>For people 65 years old and above, you should start the dosage of Gabapentin 300 mg on a low scale. It will help in preventing the excessive build-up of this drug. The functioning of the kidney declines with rising age, and the body may not be able to get rid of this drug quickly. It is the reason why we suggest that you should take the drug on a low dose. An excess of the drug in the patients' body may prove to be harmful. You can alter the dosage based on how effectively the kidneys are functioning.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there is a different dosage for partial-onset seizures. For adults between the age of 18 years to 64 years, the ideal beginning dosage of Gabapentin 300 mg should be 900 mg/day (300 mg thrice a day to be taken in an even manner throughout the day). You can raise the dosage to 2400 mg to 3600 mg per day.</p>

<p>For children between the ages of 12 to 17 years, the ideal beginning dosage should be 300 mg thrice a day, and you should evenly space the dosage in the entire day. The dosage of Gabapentin 300 mg can be raised to 2400 mg to 3600 mg per day for these people. </p>

<p>For children between the ages of 3 to 11 years, the appropriate beginning dosage should be 10 to 15 mg per kg per day. The dose should be divided into three doses and must be evenly spaced throughout the day. You can raise the dosage to fulfill the children's requirements. The maximum dosage can be 50 mg per kg per day.</p>

<p>For children between the ages of 0 to 2 years, the dosage has yet to be established. </p>

<p>For people 65 years old and above, we suggest starting with a lower dose because kidney function slows down with age, and the body may find it difficult to remove this drug in a fast manner.</p>

<p>People must consider some special considerations while taking Gabapentin 300 mg dosage. If children suffer from kidney problems and they are older than 12 years and undergoing hemodialysis, you must alter the dose of Gabapentin. It will depend on how effectively people' kidneys are functioning.</p>

<p>People must avoid taking alcohol when they are taking Gabapentin 300 mg dosage. It may trigger sleepiness because taking alcohol may make people sleepier. It may make it difficult for people to concentrate, and they may feel giddy.</p>
<h3>Side Effects of Gabapentin 300 mg</h3>
<p>Gabapentin oral capsule can trigger mild or sometimes grave side effects just like any other medication. People must remain vigilant of the vital side effects that may take place while taking Gabapentin 300 mg. </p>

<p>People may face more common side effects with the usage of Gabapentin that may include fever, viral infection, vomiting, difficulty in speaking, erratic movement, hostility, etc. According to clinical trials for medicine equivalent to</p>
<p>Neurontin, the side effects rates have been mentioned based on patients more than 12 years of age. And, few rates may vary by age. For instance, patients between the ages of 3 to 12 years got fever, viral infection, vomiting, exhaustion, and hostility.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there were no differences in side effects between men and women. If the Gabapentin side effects are in mild condition, they may disappear in some days or a few weeks. In case the side effects are severe, people are advised to get in touch with their health care professionals. </p>

<h3>What are the benefits of taking Gabapentin? </h3>
<p>People will get to unravel several potential health benefits of taking Gabapentin. Gabapentin is generally used with other medicines for controlling and preventing seizures. It has emerged quite useful in providing relief from gabapentin nerve pain following the occurrence of shingles. Shingle is an agonizing rash that takes place due to herpes zoster infection in adult people. Gabapentin is also popularly known as an anti-epileptic or anti-convulsant drug. The medicine needs to be taken regularly to seek maximum benefit from it.</p>

<p>This drug gives the best result when the quantity in the body is kept at a consistent level. This is why we advise people to take medicine in evenly spaced intervals at a similar time every day. If people take medicine 3 times per day to prevent seizures, they should not let more than 12 hours pass between doses because the seizures may arise.</p>
