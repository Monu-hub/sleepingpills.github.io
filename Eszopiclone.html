      <p>Eszopiclone has been used widely for treating a specific sleep problem, also known as insomnia. It is available in the form of oral tablets, and people can buy it as a generic drug and a brand name. Eszopiclone is sold by the brand name Lunesta. Adults are eligible to use the medicine if they face difficulty in sleeping, remain asleep, or both. Since the medicine is available in the form of a tablet, people can take it by mouth. </p>
        <h2>What are Eszopiclone Tablets? </h2>
        <p>Eszopiclone can be described as an oral tablet that can be used for treating insomnia in people. The medicine triggers relaxation, thus helping patients fall asleep or stay asleep. People can purchase Eszopiclone as a generic drug which costs much less than the brand name version of the tablet. In some scenarios, the generic drug and the brand-name drug will have different strengths and forms.</p>
        
        <p>As Eszopiclone is a controlled drug, it may cause dependence. The medicines allow people to fall asleep quicker, stay asleep for an increased duration, and reduce how frequently they wake up at night. It helps them get effective rest at night. The medicine belongs to the category of drugs known as sedative-hypnotics. </p>
        <h3>What is the drug eszopiclone used for?</h3>
        <p>Eszopiclone is predominantly used for treating insomnia conditions. Several cases of insomnia are linked with poor sleeping patterns, stress, depression, and chronic illness, among others. When people have insomnia, they face difficulty in falling asleep and remaining asleep. It is imperative to seek treatment for insomnia that will help in improving sleeping habits, identifying and curing the underlying causes.</p>
        
        <h3>How Eszopiclone 2 mg Works? </h3>
        <p>Eszopiclone 2 mg plays a vital role in enhancing the quantity of a natural chemical known as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in a patient's brain. The role of the chemical is to slow down the activity in people' brains, thus helping them to sleep. It is worth noting that people must never take this drug unless and until they get a full night sleep of at least 7-8 hours. We advise people to take Eszopiclone before they head to bed and should not take it earlier. </p>
        
        <h3>Dosage and Usage Advice for Eszopiclone Medication</h3>
        <p>The medicine is supposed to be taken by mouth just before the patient goes to bed. We advise people to not take Eszopiclone 2 mg soon after having a high fat or heavy meal as it may not produce the desired impact. The dosage will be based on the medical situation of a patient, liver functioning, other medications they may be taking, and response to the medicine. The starting dose should be 1 mg at bedtime. The dosage will eliminate the risk of facing difficulties that people may come across while doing activities that require alertness. </p>
        
        <p>Some people may not be completely alert the next day, and they may think they are fully alert. If people are taking Eszopiclone 3 mg dosage, they should avoid doing activities that require alertness the following day. If a patient happens to be an older adult and suffering from liver disease, he should start with a low dose. People should not take this drug if they do not have time to get a full nights sleep of at least 7-8 hours. It is because people may suffer from memory loss if they do not get 7-8 hours of sleep. They may also face difficulty doing activities in a safe manner that will require alertness. </p>
        
        <h3>Here is the guideline about dosage: </h3>
        <p>When it comes to Eszopiclone, it is available in the form of an oral tablet. The strengths of the medicine include 1 milligram (mg), 2 mg, and 3 mg, respectively. </p>
        <p>When it comes to brand Lunesta, the medicine is available in the form of an oral tablet. It is also available in the strengths of 1 mg, 2 mg, and 3 mg, respectively. </p>
        <p>For adults between the ages of 18 years to 64 years, the dosage will be like this: </p>
        <p>The ideal beginning dose should be 1 mg per day and must be taken before bedtime. People may increase the dosage to 2 mg or 3 mg in case they do not find any solution with a lower dosage. The maximum dosage that people may take should be 3 mg per day before bedtime. </p>
        
        <p>For children between the ages of 0 to 17 years, the dosage will be like this: </p>
        <p>There is no such confirmation yet about the safety and effectiveness of this drug for people below the age of 18 years. You should not give the medicine to children.</p>
        
        <p>For senior people of 65 years and above, the dosage will be like this: </p>
        <p>The ideal starting dosage should be 1 mg per day, and it should be taken before bedtime. The maximum dosage can be 2 mg per day before bedtime. People should not take a higher dosage of Eszopiclone; otherwise, it may cause excessive drowsiness. For people suffering from severe liver issues, the ideal dosage should be just 2 mg per day before bedtime. You should take the aforementioned dosages only once a day.</p>
        
        <p>There is also a special dosage warning that people must be aware of. We advise all the people to refrain from a higher dosage as it may cause excessive drowsiness. And, if a person is experiencing liver issues, the entire dosage should not be more than 2 mg once every day. </p>
        
        <p>If people stop taking Eszopiclone 2 mg all of a sudden, they may suffer from withdrawal symptoms. These withdrawal symptoms may include sickness, vomiting, flushing, stomach cramps, shakiness, and nervousness, among others. People may gradually reduce the dosage to prevent withdrawal symptoms.</p>
        
        <p>Withdrawal may have higher chances of occurring in case people have been taking Eszopiclone 2 mg for a longer period and in high doses. People may visit their health care professionals in such a scenario. When Eszopiclone is taken for a longer period, it may not work as effectively. People may discuss with their physician in case the medicine does not work effectively.</p>
        
        <p>Eszopiclone 3 mg has emerged as highly useful, but it may also cause addiction at times. If people miss the dosage of the drug and forget to take it on schedule, they may not be able to sleep as effectively as they would have after taking medicine. We advise the people to take the drug before bedtime because they may begin to feel sleepy before bedtime if they take it earlier. If they take the drug too late at night, they will continue to experience drowsiness the following morning.</p>
        
        <p>If people take an excessive quantity of Eszopiclone Tablets, it may turn out to be dangerous, and the symptoms will include slipping into a coma or staying excessively drowsy. If people feel they have taken excessive quantities, they may instantly visit their health care professionals.</p>
        
        <p>If people happen to miss the dose, they may take it just before bedtime and ensure to take it when they have at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep left. If fewer sleep hours are left and almost time for the next dose, they should not take medicine. They may continue with the regular dosage. People should be able to fall asleep and stay asleep if they are taking Eszopiclone Tablets. </p>
