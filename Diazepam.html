      <p>Diazepam can be used to treat febrile or epileptic seizures, as a sedative before minor surgical and dental procedures, to relieve tetanus-induced muscle spasms, and as an initial treatment for more severe anxiety and agitation.</p>
        <p>Diazepam belongs to a group of medicines known as benzodiazepines. These medications are used as sedatives, antispasmodics, and to relax tight muscles. Valium is indicated in adults and children from 2 years of age to treat anxiety, tension, and other mental or physical manifestations associated with anxiety.</p>
        <p>Valium is indicated in adults to treat: insomnia (sleep disturbances).</p>
        <p>Valium should only be used when the disorder is severe, disabling, and causes severe discomfort. Valium is an anxiolytic indicated to combat anxiety and sleep disorders in adults and children. Below you will find information on diazepam dosage and any side effects.</p>
        <h2>What Is Diazepam Used For?</h2>
        <p>Diazepam is prescribed in combination with other drugs for insomnia (mainly Diazepam for sleep disorders) and also for patients with alcohol withdrawal symptoms (including the syndrome that causes restlessness, excitement, nervous tension, transitory reactive state, and psychoneurosis)</p>
        <h3>Diazepam</h3>
        <p>Urgent short-term symptomatic treatment of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>States of strong psychotic excitement and restlessness</li>
          <li>Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (delirium tremens)</li>
          <li>Tetanus and spastic states of various etiologies</li>
          <li>Epileptic conditions</li>
          <li>For pretreatment - preparation for surgical interventions and long diagnostic procedures, e.g., for swallowing echoes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>This medicine should be taken exactly as directed by a doctor.</h3>
        <p>Doctors prescribe it for anxiety and anxiety, panic disorders, insomnia, alcohol withdrawal, muscle cramps, epilepsy, and anxiety.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Feeling of tension</li>
          <li>Excitement</li>
          <li>Anxiety issues</li>
          <li>Sleep disturbances, if at the same time calming down during the day, are desired.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The drug should only be used if the disease is severe and cannot be remedied by other measures in the short term.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Calming down before operations or diagnostic procedures</li>
          <li>Calming down after operations or diagnostic procedures</li>
          <li>Increased muscle tension</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Precautions Before Using Diazepam</h3>
        <p>Before using Diazepam, tell your doctor if you are diagnosed with the following diseases/conditions or if any of the following applies to you:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> If you are having a depression feeling (with and without anxiety)</li>
        <li> If your age is over 60</li>
        <li> If you have any diseases of the kidneys, liver disease, heart, and lungs</li>
        <li> If you have any breathing problems</li>
        <li> Epilepsy or seizures</li>
        <li> If you have any history of alcohol and drug abuse</li>
        <li> The presence of suicidal thoughts</li>
        <li> Changes in the brain, including atherosclerosis (narrowing of the blood vessels)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When given intravenously, Diazepam can slow breathing and heart rate. In rare cases, this can lead to respiratory or cardiac arrest. To avoid this, the drug is administered slowly and in the lowest possible dose of Diazepam.</p>
        <p>The attending physician will select the dose of the drug depending on the age and body weight of the child.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>During the diazepam treatment, alcohol consumption is prohibited.</li>
        
          <li>Drivers and people whose activities involve increased concentration do not need to use this medicine during work.</li>
          <li>Diazepam tablets in children under 14 years of age are only permitted in clearly justified cases; the duration of treatment should be minimal.</li>
          <li>When taking Valium tablets (even only in therapeutic doses) can lead to the development of habituation and the formation of physical and psychological dependence.</li>
          <li>Withdrawal from Diazepam should be made gradually with the dose reduction to reduce the risk of withdrawal symptoms. With sharp discontinuation after long-term ingestion or ingestion of high doses, withdrawal symptoms develop (headache and muscle pain, restlessness, worry, confusion, tremor, convulsions), in severe cases - personality alienation, hallucinations, epileptic convulsions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Diazepam Benefits</h3>
        <p>Given the use of this drug for more than 50 years, it is considered to be very safe. However, you must make rational use of this remedy, that is, use it properly, in the right dose, and for an appropriate time. Medication can be indicated to relieve symptoms related to the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Anxiety disorders - anxiety, tension, agitation associated with psychiatric disorders</li>
          <li>Reflex muscle spasm - picture arises from local trauma</li>
          <li>Spasticity - increased muscle tone due to neurological changes</li>
          <li>Alcoholic detoxification - relieves agitation, tremors, hallucinations, and delirium</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Diazepam can also be indicated to treat severe pain, tension relief before surgery, epilepsy, or acute seizures.</p>
        <p>The medical literature also describes the use of Diazepam as a sedative for patients in the ICU and short-term therapy of spasticity in children (cerebral palsy). Still, according to the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), these two indications are responsible for the surveillance of drugs and are off-label; that is, they are not included in the package leaflet.</p>
        <h3>Dosage & Usage Instructions For Diazepam Tablets</h3>
        <p>Always use Diazepam exactly as your doctor has told you. If you are not sure about the dose, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
        <p>The dose is determined individually by your doctor.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diazepam can be used to treat adults, infants, and children (over 10 kg).</li>
          <li>The tubes are disposable for rectal administration. The average dose is 0.25-0.5 mg/kg body weight, but this may vary depending on the patient's weight, age, and health.</li>
          <li>Diazepam Desitin rectal solution is available in unit pack sizes of 5 and Diazepam 10 mg.</li>
          <li>Because Diazepam Desitin is available in fixed pack sizes of 5 and diazepam 10 mg, you should adjust the dose to the next available dose.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Unless Your Doctor Tells You Otherwise:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The recommended dose is normally a 5 mg tube for children aged 1 to 3 years (10-15 kg), one 10 mg tube for children over 3 years (over 15 kg), and two 10 mg tubes for adults. It would be a tube.</li>
          <li>If no effect is observed after 10 minutes, the above dose can be re-administered in children and an additional Diazepam 10 mg tube in adults.</li>
          <li>The Diazepam Desitin rectal tube is particularly suitable for clinical, emergency intervention, while it is less suitable for long-term use. The duration of treatment should be limited to a few single doses or, in the case of acute illness, to a few days!</li>
          <li>However, if long-term treatment is required, the prescribed dose may be re-administered every 12 hours. If the cramps do not go away, consult a doctor.</li>
          <li>You should only give diazepam Desitin rectal solution to children after careful medical consideration; the duration of treatment should be as short as possible.</li>
          <li>Elderly and debilitated patients receive no more than half the usual adult dose!</li>
          <li>In hepatic and renal insufficiency, you should also use a lower dose. In case the risk of diazepam side effects is higher even at normal doses. The treatment should be as short as possible! You should use the lowest possible dose to eliminate symptoms.</li>
          <li>If used continuously for too long, diazepam dependence may develop, or withdrawal symptoms may occur after discontinuation of the drug.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="faq-head">Common Side Effects Of Diazepam</h3>
        <h3>The Most Commonly Reported Side Effects Are:</h3>
        <p>Tiredness, drowsiness, and muscle weakness, in general, are related to the dose administered. These effects occur predominantly at the beginning of treatment and usually disappear with prolonged administration.</p>
        <h3>Disorders of the nervous system</h3>
        <p>Ataxia, dysarthria, slurred speech, headache, tremors, dizziness, decreased alertness. Anterograde amnesia can occur with therapeutic doses, and the risk increases with higher doses. Amnesic effects can be associated with inappropriate behavior.</p>
        <h3>Psychiatric disorders</h3>
        <p>Paradoxical reactions such as restlessness, agitation, irritability, disorientation, aggression, nervousness, hostility, anxiety, delusions, anger, nightmares, abnormal dreams, hallucinations, psychoses, hyperactivity, inappropriate behavior, and other known behavioral effects.</p>
        <p>These effects are more likely in children and the elderly and, if they occur, you should discontinue the use of the drug. Confusional state, emotional and mood disorders,</p>
        <h3>Important Considerations For Taking Diazepam</h3>
        <p>Tell your doctor if you are taking it for the long term or have recently taken or are about to take any other drugs. It applies to any herbal remedies or medications that you bought without a doctor's prescription.</p>
        <p>Some drugs can be used with Diazepam, while others can cause side effects when used together.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The combination of Diazepam and opioid analgesics (strong pain relievers, substitution medications, and some cough medications) increases the risk of drowsiness, difficulty breathing (respiratory depression), coma, and death. Because of these risks, the combined use of Diazepam and opioid analgesics is possible only in the absence of alternative treatment.</li>
          <li>Tell your doctor about all the pain relievers you are taking. If you are prescribed Diazepam simultaneously with opioid analgesics, you should use the minimum dose with the minimum duration of therapy. The dose prescribed by the doctor must be carefully observed. It is recommended to inform friends or family about the signs and symptoms like sleep apnea. If you experience these symptoms, you should contact your doctor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is very important to tell your healthcare professional if you have recently taken any of the medications listed below.</p>
            <ul>
        <li> Antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine)</li>
        <li> Antipsychotics, such as clozapine, olanzapine, zotepine (drugs for the treatment of mental disorders)</li>

        <li> Muscle relaxants (eg, suxamethonium, tubocurarine)</li>
        <li> Strong pain relievers (such as morphine)</li>
        <li> Drugs for the treatment of epilepsy (phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine, sodium valproate)</li>
        <li> Drugs to lower blood pressure, diuretics (diuretics), nitrates (to treat heart disease)</li>
        <li> Antacids (drugs that reduce the acidity of the stomach)</li>
        <li> Antiviral drugs (atazanavir, ritonavir, delavirdine, efavirenz, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, zidovudine)</li>
        <li> Disulfiram (a drug used to treat alcohol dependence)</li>
        <li> Antifungal drugs (fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, or voriconazole)</li>
        <li> Oral contraceptives</li>
        <li> Corticosteroids</li>
        <li> Theophylline (a drug used to treat asthma and other breathing disorders)</li>
        <li> Isoniazid (a drug used to treat tuberculosis)</li>
        <li> Cisapride (a drug for the treatment of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract)</li>
        <li> Cimetidine, omeprazole, esomeprazole</li>
        <li> Levodopa (a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease)</li>
        <li> Ketamine (used for anesthesia)</li>
        <li> Lofexidine (a drug to relieve withdrawal symptoms when opioids are stopped)</li>
