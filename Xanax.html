      <p>Xanax has emerged useful in treating panic disorders and stress in people. It has now become the only most used psychiatric medicine in the United States of America. The medicine is also known as Alprazolam and belongs to the drug group benzodiazepines.  </p>
        <h2>What is Xanax & how it works?</h2>

<p>Anti-stress medicine Xanax is widely used for treating stress and comes from the benzodiazepine family-Xanax functions by reducing the unusual exhilaration in the human brain. The medicine got approval from the Food and Drug Administration way back in 1981. It is important to mention that Benzodiazepine works on the brain and central nervous system or CNS to generate a soothing effect.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Xanax can significantly reduce brain chemicals' movement that may have lost its balance, thus leading to a decline in stress and nervous tension. Apart from this, Xanax plays a vital role in enhancing the impact of a natural chemical known as gamma-aminobutyric acid that is generated in the brain. Anxiety disorders can be described as extreme stress or tension over things for some time. It is worth mentioning that general tension issues linked with the stress of day-to-day life generally do not need treatment with Xanax. The medicine has been categorized for the treatment of a panic disorder. It is also used for treating anxiety linked with depression. </p>
<h3>What are the side effects of Alprazolam?</h3>
<p>People of Alprazolam may endure some side effects of the medicine. Every medicine has some side effects. Similarly, Alprazolam may also cause some side effects.

<h3>Xanax withdrawal symptoms</h3>

According to the dosage and how frequently People take Xanax, the withdrawal experience may range from uncomfortable to extremely unpleasant. It may turn out to be medically grave. Xanax for anxiety provides relief to individuals suffering from acute stress.</p>

<p>However, it is not meant for long-term usage. The prolonged use of Xanax may cause issues with dependence and withdrawal. If People happen to take Xanax many times a day, quitting Xanax may take some time, strong will, and patience. The only appropriate way is to reduce the Xanax dosages gradually.</p>
<p>Given below are the Xanax withdrawal symptoms: </p>

<p>The symptoms of Xanax withdrawal may be different from one individual to another. According to research, nearly 40 percent of individuals taking Xanax may endure light to extreme withdrawal symptoms for over six months. Meanwhile, 60 percent of individuals may experience mild symptoms. A large number of people quitting Xanax may face a slight rise in their stress levels. According to the gravity of the symptoms, People may endure stress worse than the pre-treatment level. People may commonly feel anxious and nervous during their taper.</p>

<p>Several individuals undergo agitation and irritability that may lead to issues at the workplace, school, or home. People may easily lose their temper with family members and friends. People may also feel depressed.  </p>

<p>Insomnia has emerged as yet another common symptom of Xanax withdrawal. And, insomnia may turn out to be mentally as well as physically tiring, thus causing more anxiety and nervousness. Symptoms may appear or disappear during the Xanax taper. Also, at some point, People may witness physical symptoms like muscle aches, tremors in hands, and headaches.</p>

<p>The other likely symptoms of withdrawals may include physical and psychological. Under physical symptoms, People may get insomnia, muscle spasms, sweating, racing pulse, hyperventilation, seizures, etc. The psychological symptoms of withdrawal may include remaining anxious, depressed, and restless, etc. People may also get panic attacks, trouble in concentration, hallucination, delirium, etc. Xanax withdrawal symptoms generally surface within 8 to 12 hours of the last dose People have taken. In case People find it difficult to taper their dose, their withdrawal symptoms may gradually become severe. </p>

<p>Withdrawal tends to be at its most difficult level on day two and shows improvement by day four. Meanwhile, severe symptoms may remain for a longer period and also known as protracted withdrawal. It can be described as a long-term withdrawal experience that may include waves of minor psychological symptoms that may appear and disappear for some months. In some cases, protracted Xanax withdrawal may last for nearly one year. </p>
<h3>Xanax Usage & Guidelines</h3>
<p>We suggest that you should not take xanax dosages in larger quantities or for a longer period. If People feel the need to take more of this medicine, they must get in touch with their health care professionals. We also suggest that People of Xanax not share the medicine with other individuals, particularly with somebody having a history of drug abuse. The misuse of Xenox may cause addiction or death in extreme cases. People are also advised to keep the medicine in such a place where children or someone else cannot access it. People should not be selling Xenox medicine to someone else.</p>

<p>When it comes to taking the Xanax dosages, we advise them just to swallow the entire tablet. They should not grind, crush, or break the tablet before taking it. Xanax should not be consumed for more than 4 months' period for treating anxiety disorder. For treating panic disorder, we advise People not to take it for more than 10 weeks. People may contact their health care professionals if they do not notice any improvement in their symptoms or if the symptoms become worse.</p>

<p>If People decide to use the medicine for a longer period, they should get some regular medical tests done. People should also not stop the consumption of Alprazolam Xanax abruptly as they may experience some difficult withdrawal symptoms. They are advised to store the medicine at room temperature. It should not come in contact with heat, light, and moisture. People must keep a good track of their medicine to avoid its misuse. Here is the comprehensive dosage information of Xanax: </p>
<h3>Dose for adults for treating anxiety: </h3>
<p>We suggest that the appropriate adult dose for anxiety should be 0.25 to 0.5 mg. It can be orally administered three times every day. The maximum dose per day should not be more than 4 mg.</p>
<h3>Dose for adult for treating panic disorder:</h3>
<p>We suggest that People should be administered 0.5 mg orally 3 times every day. Also, the maximum dose that an adult may take per day should not be more than 10 mg. </p>

<p>The beginning dose should remain between 0.5 to 1 mg once a day when it comes to extended-release tablets. The maintenance dose should be 3 to 6 mg per day. It can be orally administered ideally in the morning. And the maximum dose should not be more than 10mg per day.</p>

<p>It is important to mention here that the least possible useful dose needs to administer and you must reevaluate the requirement for constant treatment frequently. Also, the dosage should be brought down gradually when People intend to discontinue the therapy or when reducing the daily dosage. You can reduce the everyday dosage by not more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Meanwhile, a few People may need a slower dosage reduction.</p>

<p>And, you can raise the dosage of extended-release tablets at the gaps of 3 to 4 days in increases of not more than 1 mg/day. The period of administration of dosage should be distributed as much evenly as possible all through the waking hours.</p>

<p>In case of the development of side effects, it is ideal for bringing down the dose. The least possible useful dose must be administered. Also, you must bring down the dosage slowly if People plan to discontinue the therapy. If People missed the dose, they should take it at the earliest. However, People may skip the dose if it is almost time for the next dose. We suggest that People must not take two doses at one time in a day as it may cause severe side effects.</p>

<p>If there is an overdose, People should seek immediate medical care. The symptoms of overdose may include excessive drowsiness, loss of balance, fainting, or feeling light-headedness. </p>

<p>People must avoid taking alcohol while taking Xanax medicine. It may lead to severe side effects or even death in an extreme situation. People should also avoid driving or performing some dangerous activity until they discover how this medicine will impact them. </p>

<p>Also, there should be no consumption of grapefruit while taking Xanax, as it may also give rise to some side effects.</p>
