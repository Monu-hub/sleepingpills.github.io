            <h2>What is Anxiety?</h2>
            <p>In today's world, it is really difficult for a person to escape anxiety. Almost everyone experiences
              anxiety symptoms in life; of course, its density and regularity might differ from person to person. It is
              primarily a mental health disorder characterized by feelings of worry, tension, uneasiness, and fear.
              These feelings of worry, tension, and fear might become so overwhelming for a person that they might begin
              to hinder their everyday activities and functioning. Anxiety can be triggered due to uncertainties, like
              just before a student enters an examination hall before a person makes an important decision. Sometimes
              anxiety might give a person a boost to perform exceedingly well and motivate a person to achieve more.</p>
            <h3>What do Anxiety disorders include?</h3>
            <p>It is inevitable to escape feeling anxious sometimes or when put under really stressful situations, but
              when the feeling of anxiety refuses to settle down and becomes constant, it can most definitely be termed
              as an anxiety disorder. People with anxiety disorders need help, and we are here to give it to them.
              Anxiety symptoms and disorders are more chronic compared to normal feelings of fear; they cause problems
              in the productivity levels and the confidence of a person suffering from it. Normal anxiety can be termed
              as a disorder when a person's response to situations becomes uncontrollable, and the person might
              overreact to the slightest of problems. It might get to a point where a person just wouldn't want to get
              out of bed. Following are certain symptoms that can be typically seen in the case of anxiety disorder -
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0"><strong>Emotional symptoms-</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Imagining and anticipating the worst-case scenarios always.</li>
              <li>Constantly feeling tense or jumpy.</li>
              <li>Feelings of apprehension or dread.</li>
              <li>Feeling restlessness or irritability.</li>
              <li>Keeping an eye and constantly worrying about the danger signs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-0"><strong>Physical symptoms-</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bad headaches and fatigue.</li>
              <li>Not being able to sleep at night- insomnia.</li>
              <li>Increased heart rate and gasping for breath.</li>
              <li>Frequent trips to the washroom due to an upset stomach, constant urination.</li>
              <li>Sweating, tremors, and twitches.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Treatments for anxiety.</h3>
            <p><strong>Self-Help treatments-</strong> What is Anxiety? The simple answer is, sometimes when the anxiety
              is not excessive, a person can treat it at home without clinical supervision. But these treatments only
              help if the feelings are not extremely overpowering.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Healthy eating habits- consuming a lot of caffeine and alcohol leads to increased anxiety. The food
                habits of a person directly impact their overall mental well being so you must surely cut down on sodas,
                chocolate, tea, amongst other unhealthy foods. Your diet must include a healthy mix of fresh fruits and
                vegetables and other food items that are high in vitamins and protein.</li>
              <li>Working out any form of exercise can help produce happy hormones in the body and ease anxiety. It does
                not have to be a very hectic exercise; something even as light as a walk is good; you could also simply
                play your favorite sport or maybe learn a new dance form or even do something as fun as kickboxing. Do
                whatever sails your boat as long as you are moving that body of yours.</li>
              <li>Confide in a friend or family- you must surround yourself with empathetic people towards how you feel,
                and you can comfortably open about your feelings. A good confidant can do you good.</li>
              <li>Deep breaths- Lie down on a flat surface and put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest.
                Take a slow breath in, hold it for a second, and then slowly release it. Deep breathing gives out a
                message to your brain that you are doing 'okay.' It helps relax your mind as well as your body.</li>
              <li>Maintain a journal- if you don't have a friend or a family member, you can confide your feelings. Pour
                out your feelings in a diary, write down how you feel daily. It makes you more aware of your feelings
                and helps you to monitor your pattern. This, in turn, might help you to deal with anxiousness in a
                better way.</li>
              <li>Sleep- a minimum of eight hours of sleep is required for a healthy mind and body. If your stress isn't
                letting you sleep, try a few sleeping hacks like staying away from the phone during bedtime, lighting a
                candle, counting from 1 to 100, amongst others.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Counseling -</strong> counseling is a standard method of treating nervousness. Experts of CBT
              desire to restrict mutilated thinking and change how individuals respond to objects or circumstances that
              give way to anxiety.</p>
            <p><strong>Medications-</strong> when your fear gets out of your hands, you hardly get any sleep and feel
              almost paralyzed by fear, it's best to turn towards medication. Several types of drugs are used to treat
              anxiety disorders. They don't eradicate anxiety, but they play a huge role in managing a person's symptoms
              to function in their everyday life. Different medications can be prescribed to different individuals
              depending on what works best for them. Following are the main types of medications used.</p>
            <h3>Types of Anxiety Medication</h3>
            <p>The Four major classes of drugs for anxiety disorders are-</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors- albeit Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are a kind of
                antidepressant; they can be utilized in individuals with anxiety side effects and Obsessive-Compulsive
                problems. These are said to be the first-line drug treatment for anxiety disorders. It works by halting
                nerve cells in mind from reabsorbing serotonin, which is a compound that assumes an imperative part in
                mood regulation. These are generally taken for 12 months.</li>
              <li>Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors- are another type of antidepressant to treat anxiety as
                well as depression. These medications work by lessening the cerebrum's reabsorption of the synthetic
                compounds serotonin and norepinephrine. It can require a little while for this medication to show
                results.</li>
              <li>Tricyclic antidepressants- these are a type of antidepressants that have been in the business for
                quite some time. Although they are used in treating depression and anxiety, they don't have a lot of
                side effects like the other antidepressants.</li>
              <li>Benzodiazepines are a type of sedatives that reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as muscle
                tension. They additionally empower unwinding and are powerful inside a couple of moments. They are
                highly effective, especially initially, but over some time, the person may get addicted to these.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Role of medication in anxiety</h3>
            <p>Anxiety medications, as mentioned earlier, alter the level of chemical imbalances in an individual's body
              but can completely cure anxiousness. These medications are used alone or along with psychotherapy to treat
              several disorders, all clubbed together.</p>
            <p>What are the best anxiety pills and panic attack medication?</p>
            <p>These are the 3-best medication for anxiety we have listed for you-</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Xanax- Alprazolam sold under the brand name Xanax. It is a short-acting tranquilizer that works in the
                short-term management of nervousness problems. Sometimes may also be used in the treatment of
                chemotherapy. A person with Generalized anxiety disorder might feel a sense of improvement within a week
                of taking Xanax. Xanax is generally taken by mouth. According to certain studies, the advantages of
                Xanax last simply 4 to 10 weeks in the case of treating panic disorders. Xanax comes with its fair share
                of side effects like every other medication, including feeling lethargic, difficulty remembering things
                or memory problems, lack of sleep, dry mouth, and others. But with time, the feeling of tiredness and
                sedations subsides down a little. One must never suddenly stop using Xanax as that would cause
                withdrawal symptoms; one must first gradually reduce its use and then stop consuming it. It is a
                medication used for anxiety.</li>
              <li>Clonazepam- this medication is used to treat panic attacks and restlessness by calming your brain and
                nerves. It is also used to control and prevent seizures. It belongs to a class of drugs called
                benzodiazepines. This medication is also generally taken by mouth about 2 to 3 times a day. The dosage
                primarily depends on the age, weight, medical condition of a person. Though clonazepam helps deal with
                anxiety, it may sometimes cause addiction. This might become a serious problem for a person who already
                has an existing addiction to alcohol or drugs. Clonazepam may increase the danger of dangerous breathing
                issues, so one must be very careful and aware. This is an anxiety disorder medication.</li>
              <li>Etizolam- is mainly used for its anxiolytic and sedative properties. Apart from which it also has
                hypnotic, amnesic, muscle relaxing properties. It has a huge consumption in Japan, Italy, and India.
                People using it have reported feelings of significantly less anxiety, loss of inhibition, relaxation,
                euphoria, etc. It is usually taken from the mouth, and the medicine starts to kick in anywhere between
                30 minutes to 2 hours. Constant and increased use of Etizolam can cause an increase in blood prolactin
                levels, spontaneous production of breast milk, infertility, erectile dysfunction in men, contractions or
                twitches, and even skin lesions. Like the other two medications, you just can't spontaneously stop
                consuming Etizolam; you have to withdraw from it slowly. This is an anxiety disorder medication.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are the best medications for anxiety. Knowing these anxiety medication names can be informative and
              helpful.</p>
            <h3>What are the side effects of anti-anxiety medication?</h3>
            <p>Antidepressants and anxiety medication side effects can be daunting. Even though they are very helpful,
              they have a lot of side effects. The side effects usually differ from person to person. Genes and existing
              health conditions can all impact the way particular anti-anxiety meds or anti-anxiety tablets affect you.
              So before consuming them, you must be aware of their side effects. We have listed down the major ones
              below for you-</p>
            <p>Weight Gain- ant-depressants can lead to weight gain and illnesses related to weight gains like type 2
              diabetes and hypertension. The confusing part here would be that it is very difficult to measure how much
              weight gain or loss can be attributed to the drug and how much can be attributed to the person's normal
              behavior related to food.</p>
            <p>Increased or decreased sleep- certain anti-anxiety pills or anti-anxiety tablets might make you tired,
              and some might make you extra energetic. In the first situation, you might not be able to go about your
              routine normally as you might not perform activities with rapt attention. In the second scenario, a lack
              of a substantial amount of sleep will ultimately lead to problems in the longer run.</p>
            <p>Sexual Problems- anti-anxiety meds can also result in a low sex drive in both men and women. Studies have
              shown that men in the past have become infertile because of these drugs and have also faced erectile
              dysfunction. As for women, studies have shown that they were unable to experience orgasm due to the drugs
              they were consuming. But if you ever face such a problem switching to an alternate drug seems to help.</p>
            <p>Suicide- in some cases, which get worse, people even tend to commit suicide by an overdose of
              anti-anxiety meds. The consumption of this medication sometimes leads to destructive thoughts of suicide,
              especially during the first month of treatment.</p>
            <p>Other really common symptoms are nausea, blurred vision, dry mouth, agitation, and fatigue.</p>
            <h3>Precautions and dosages for anxiety medication?</h3>
            <p>You need to understand that abruptly discontinuing the usage of these drugs would cause serious problems,
              and so will an overdose. You have to be very careful while consuming them and advise a professional to
              avoid the risk factors. The dosage should also be taken only as advised, not more or less.</p>
