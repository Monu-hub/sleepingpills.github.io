            <h2>What are sleeping tablets?</h2>
            <p>As the name specifies, sleeping pills are prescribed by doctors for people who are suffering from
              Insomnia and other sleep disorders. The best sleeping pills will exude a calming effect and let you sleep
              peacefully for a considerable amount of time. If you have disturbed sleep, insomnia treatment can be
              helpful to have a good night's sleep. You can either go for sedatives or hypnotics.</p>
            <p>It would be better if you choose prescribed medication or over-the-counter pills. Many individuals have
              found melatonin, valerian root, and hypnotics as effective options to sleep peacefully. At times,
              benzodiazepines and Z drugs are used as sleeping pills. Some of the benzodiazepines drugs include
              loprazolam and nitrazepam. Drugs such as Zolpidem are not benzodiazepines, but they can create a similar
              effect in the brain cells.</p>
            <h3>What Is Insomnia?</h3>
            <p>Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that affects millions of individuals across the globe. People with
              Insomnia might struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep. Adults need a minimum of seven hours of sleep every
              day, and it can be up to nine hours. However, people in the US encounter insomnia frequently.</p>
            <p>People who have acute Insomnia will experience health hazards like exhaustive feelings, loss of
              concentration, and more. Chronic Insomnia can be the root cause of various serious health conditions.
              Chronic diseases such as depression, cardiovascular disease, diabetes are the result of missing the
              regular sleep cycle. Usually, people who have Insomnia can be lazy, feel sick mentally and physically, and
              mood swings.</p>
            <h3 class="faq-sec">Types of Insomnia</h3>
            <h3>Classification based on the cause</h3>
            <p>There are two types of Insomnia, namely primary and secondary Insomnia. People who have primary Insomnia
              don't have their sleep disorder connected with underlying health conditions. However, secondary Insomnia
              is linked with a health condition like asthma, cancer, heartburn, and more.</p>
            <h3>Classification based on the duration</h3>
            <p>The sleep disorder is classified as acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). In some patients, the
              sleep disorder affects people frequently and goes away without any medications. If a person has acute
              Insomnia, the duration can be measured from one day to a few weeks. For people who have chronic Insomnia,
              the sleep disorder may affect as long as three months. People need to be safe by taking proper sleep aid
              medications for a sleep disorder.</p>
            <h3>Classification based on the severity</h3>
            <p>If you have mild Insomnia, it is due to a lack of sleep and exhaustive feeling. Moderate Insomnia can
              affect your daily life, whereas severe Insomnia can have a serious impact on your health conditions. There
              are diverse factors considered to determine the type of Insomnia.</p>
            <h3>How to prevent Insomnia?</h3>
            <p>If you want to prevent Insomnia, it is essential to have good sleep practices, aka sleep hygiene.
              Firstly, have the proper timing to sleep and wake up. If you sleep at 22.00 hours and wake up at 5 or 6 in
              the morning, try to maintain the same timing every day. The sleep cycles can be disturbed if you take naps
              in the daytime. Try to stop taking naps in the day and sleep simultaneously to get used to the timing.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You should avoid using phones before bed as the lights can hinder your sleep cycle.</li>
              <li>It is essential to skip caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, keeping you awake for a long time. In
                addition, people who drink alcohol have troubled sleep leading to lower sleep quality.</li>
              <li>Ensure that you indulge in regular physical activities, but you shouldn't work out before bedtime. It
                can hinder your sleep cycle so work out three hours before you go to bed.</li>
              <li>Avoid heavy meals during the night and have a few snacks before going to bed. Also, it might be hard
                to sleep without eating, so ensure you have some food before sleep.</li>
              <li>It will be easier to fall asleep if the room is dark and cool. A quiet room is all you need to sleep
                peacefully. If you have been finding it hard to sleep due to noise problems, use earplugs.</li>
              <li>You can listen to music or read a book before you go to bed. It can be soothing and relaxes your mind
                to sleep peacefully.</li>
            </ul>

              to your doctor before consuming one.</p>
            <h3>Precautions & dosages before taking a sleep medication?</h3>
            <p>The dosage is based on the sleep medicine you take, and it would be better if you have the
              doctor-prescribed medications. If you have any health problems, it is essential to address them with the
              doctor or pharmacist.</p>
            <p>You can tell the doctor to provide a medication that doesn't interact with your existing medication.

              Avoid such unpleasant situations by conversing with the doctor precisely. Then, follow the doctor's
              instructions to stay safe and sleep peacefully.</p>
            <p>If you miss a dose on any day, it is better to move on with the next day. You shouldn't take the missed
              dosage with subsequent medication, resulting in serious sleeping pills' side effects. Overdose of
              medications can be life-threatening, so follow the doctor's words without any doubts. If you want to stop
              the sleep medication, talk to the doctor as abrupt termination of the current medication can result in
              withdrawal symptoms.</p>
            <h3>What are the side effects of sleeping pills?</h3>

              lung diseases, and COPD. Other than this, people experienced side effects like constipation, diarrhea,
              drowsiness, headache, heartburn, nightmares, weakness, constipation, and more. Therefore, it is essential
              to know the adverse effects of sleeping pills to stop the medication when encountering any difficulties.

            <p>Over-the-counter medications can be acquired easily from the stores, but prescription medications need a
              doctor's advice. Moreover, prescribed sleeping pills are more powerful than over-the-counter sleeping
              pills. In OTC medications, an antihistamine is an active ingredient. The drug is one of the allergy
              medications, but it is also helpful in falling asleep as the drug can make you drowsy. Melatonin and
              valerian are other supplements used by individuals. The working of these medications is different but
              assures relaxation and sleep. Though these medications are easily available in the stores, it is essential
              to connect with the doctor before consumption. You might have a word with the healthcare professional to
              check whether the medication is safe for you. When it comes to sleeping pills, antidepressants,
              benzodiazepines, and Z-drugs are commonly prescribed by doctors.</p>
